Abstract:

Seasonal influenza (H3N2) imposes a large annual health burden across the world.
Phylogeographic inference plays an increasingly critical role in unravelling the
global migration patterns followed by new strains that emerge from the tropics
on a yearly basis. On smaller scales, however, there is much that remains a
mystery.  For instance, how many strains enter New Zealand each year? How do
they circulate within the country?  What are the main drivers of this movement?

In this talk we will present results of an ongoing project to address these and
other questions through both separate and joint analysis of spatially sampled
genetic data and mobile phone movement data. We show that these analyses
provide evidence for multiple epidemic-spawning strains entering the country
each year and for spatial structure in the genetic data.  We consider the
degree to which this is explained by the mobile phone-derived movement data and
further use this data to help infer the seasonal movement of the virus.
